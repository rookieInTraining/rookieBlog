Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of the internet. My name is Ish. ðŸ‘‹. I've been navigating this world since October, 1989. 

## What I Do
By day, I'm the Director of Quality Assurance and Automation, where I lead an amazing team of software engineers and testers. We're the folks behind the scenes making sure that when you use some of the B2B and B2C platform, everything works smoothly and securely. It's like being a digital detective â€“ we hunt down bugs, optimize performance, and ensure that every feature is working just as it should.

## My Journey
My tryst with software quality started over 12 years ago, and it's been quite a ride! I've had the privilege of working across various domains â€“ from ensuring gamers have seamless experiences in virtual worlds to helping travelers book their dream vacations. Each project has been a new adventure, teaching me something valuable about creating software that not only works but delights users.

## Tech Toolbox
If you're curious about the nitty-gritty, I'm all about automating the boring stuff so we can focus on the challenging and fun parts of software testing. I wield an arsenal of tools including Jira, Appium, Selenium, and TestNG. We speak multiple languages too â€“ Java, Python, JavaScript, you name it! And don't get me started on APIs; I find RESTful interfaces particularly intriguing.

## Beyond the Code
While I love diving deep into code and test scripts, I realized there's more to creating great software than just technical skills. That's why I pursued an Executive MBA, focusing on Leadership, Strategy, and Digital Marketing. It's been eye-opening to view software development through a business lens and understand how our work directly impacts customer satisfaction and business growth.

## Why I Blog
This blog is my way of giving back to the tech community and sharing the lessons I've learned along the way. Here, you'll find posts about:

* The latest trends in software testing and quality assurance
* Tips and tricks for effective test automation
* Insights on leading tech teams and fostering a culture of quality
